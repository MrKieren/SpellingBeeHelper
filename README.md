# Spelling Bee Helper

Update the Spelling Bee game on the New York Times website to add Today's Hints to the game screen.

Stop using multiple windows to keep track of the words you still have left to find.

The word grid and two letter list are kept up to date based on what you've already found. No more manually counting how many 5 letter words you've found!

You can start using the Spelling Bee helper by installing it for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/spelling-bee-helper/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spelling-bee-helper/ilbdolhmhkjhecehbdcneffapakklbgh).
